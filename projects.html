            <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>After seeing many other examples of portfolio websites, I decided it would be fun to create 
                <a href="site.html">my own</a>, even though I'd be starting off with not very much experience in CSS 
                outside of a class project I did. Overall I feel like I learned a lot through developing this website,
                especially how important being willing to start from scratch multiple times can be.

            <h1>Set Card Game</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>In fall 2022, I took my first web applications course. Thanks to my first group project in this course,
                I learned a lot about JavaScript. In <a href="set.html">this project</a>, we recreated the card game 
                "set" using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Outside of programming, I also learned a lot about version
                control and how to coordinate development with a group.
            </p>

            <h1>Calculator</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>My first attempt at both a Python project and creating a UI is a <a href="calculator.html">calculator</a>
                that I created using the tkinter library in Python. Before starting this project, I had no Python experience 
                outside of basic arithmetic, but after working on it I felt comfortable enough with Python to use it rather 
                than C for a class project.
