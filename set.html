            <h1>Set Card Game</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>My first group project in my web applications class was to recreate the set card game using JavaScript. I
                had never heard of set before this project, but rules basically go as follows. There are 4
                characteristics to each card, the shape, color, number of shapes, and shading of the shape. The goal is
                to create "sets" of 3 cards, and in order for the cards to be a set, they must:
            <ul>
                <li>Have the same number or have three different numbers.</li>
                <li>Have the same shape or have three different shapes.</li>
                <li>Have the same shading or have three different shadings.</li>
                <li>Have the same color or have three different colors.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The development for this project was a bit slow at first, as my group still had to figure out how to
                use JavaScript. Once we had a basic layout for our code with classes, development sped up quite a bit.
                My primary responsibilities in this project were the end game screen, the visuals for the cards, and
                adding an additional feature that was not included in the assignment as a requirement. For the
                additional feature, I added a "pause" feature that would hide the cards when the user would tab out,
                which doubled as cheat protection so the user wouldn't try to dodge the timer by tabbing out. This
                taught me a lot about the inner workings of JavaScript, such as passing funtions into setInterval, which
                proved to be more of a pain than I anticipated, especially when interacting with multiple intervals. As
                a result of troubleshooting the implementation of this pause function, I also learned a lot about how
                classes in JavaScript work.

            <p>The project repository is posted <a href="https://github.com/tomasmkennedy/set">here.</a> The original
                repository is private as it was used for classwork, so this is a reupload of the final code.</p>
