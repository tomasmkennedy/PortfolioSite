            <h1>Creating a Calculator</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I originally got the idea to create a calculator app after learning that Apple still hadn't developed a
                calculator app for their iPad, thinking that it couldn't be too hard to develop. For that reason, the
                visuals and layout are loosely based on the iOS calculator app.

            <h1>Project Repository</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The project repository is posted <a href="https://github.com/tomasmkennedy/calculator">here.</a>
                Currently most
                features
                are only available on mac due to tkinter specific issues on mac devices. I typically do development on
                my M1
                macbook,
                so at the time of developing this project I was unable to do testing on Windows.</p>

            <h1>Development</h1>

            <p>To start off, I had to learn how to utilize the tkinter library. The first issue I ran into is that
                tkinter
                has visual bugs on devices running Mac OS, so I found a library called <a
                    href="https://pypi.org/project/tkmacosx/">tkmacosx</a>
                that allowed me to change the background color of buttons. There were more issues that I ran into as I
                developed calculator functions, such as using global variables to keep track of colors and which "side"
                of
                the calculator the user wanted to interact with. Through my experimentation, I learned more about lambda
                functions and how to take advantage of classes in Python.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, I learned a lot about Python through this project. It gave me the confidence later in the school
                year to
                opt to use Python for a <a href="tree.html">class project</a>, rather than languages I was more
                comfortable
                with at the time.
