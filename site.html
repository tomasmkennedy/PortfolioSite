            <h1>Creating A Website</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I have never fully developed a website on my own, so I learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process of
                creating this one. My main reason for creating this website was to act as a portfolio website, however I
                learned quite a bit in the process and became more interested in front end development as a result.

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>To start off the development of this website, I actually copied and pasted the CSS styles and some
                HTML from my set card game project. The original idea was to have an introduction about myself followed
                by some projects displayed in cards, however this didn't look good and wasn't very responsive. After
                some tinkering and attempts to make this look better, I ended up scrapping the entire website I had at
                that point and kept iterating until I settled on the format I have now.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot about how CSS styling works thanks to doing multiple iterations and changing the layout
                several times, which was more complicated than I expected. Creating color variables sped up deciding on
                color themes, since having a single point of change is amazing. Media queries were useful for improving
                responsiveness as well, since the website's navigation bar ran into issues as
